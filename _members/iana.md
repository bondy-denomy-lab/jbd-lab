description: "Iana joined the Bondy-Denomy Lab in November 2022 as a post-doctoral scholar. She completed her graduate work in Konstantin Severinov's Lab at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Russia, where she studied CRISPR-Cas Type II effectors and their application in genome editing. In the Bondy-Denomy lab, Iana studies various Pseudomonas aeruginosa immune systems. She is also interested in the interplay between transposons and prokaryotic immune systems and the role of mobile genetic elements in the formation of defense islands. On weekends you can find Iana at the San Francisco Children's Museums and playgrounds where she has fun with her family. "
