description: "Tim is a post-doc in the Bondy-Denomy lab focused on characterizing the anti-phage systems of Gram-positive bacteria. He received his BSc in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Waterloo in Canada. He then did his PhD in the lab of Dr. John Whitney at McMaster University, studying how the type VII secretion system of Streptococcus intermedius exports toxic effectors. Tim spends his free time exploring the great city of San Francisco with his wife and dog and philosophizing over the finer points of Canadian vs. American culture (mostly in favour of Canada)."
