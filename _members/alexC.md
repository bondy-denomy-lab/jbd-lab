description: "Alex is a postdoctoral scholar and joined the lab in October 2023. Alex grew up in the Bay Area in Daly City and obtained a degree in Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology at UCLA. He completed his PhD at MIT in the Department of Biology where he conducted his research in the lab of [Dr. Sebastian Lourido](https://louridolab.wi.mit.edu/) studying a single-cell eukaryotic pathogenic parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. His work focused on understanding the signaling events controlling virulence factor secretion that is required for infection. His work leveraged a combination of quantitative proteomics, biochemistry and light microscopy. In the Bondy-Denomy lab, Alex is now studying a more ancient battle between bacteria and the viruses that infect them. Alex is interested in developing genetic and biochemical approaches to identify new defense and anti-defense strategies used by these organisms. In his free time, Alex enjoys climbing, hiking, cooking, playing board games and learning about honey bees."
