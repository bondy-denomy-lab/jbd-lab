description: "Wearn-Xin is a postdoc who joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in August 2023. Wearn-Xin grew up in the sunny island of Singapore and completed her graduate work in the [Tang lab](https://tang.path.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford in the UK, where she finished her PhD with understanding movement of plasmids in Neisseria spp. After spending years deciding between researching on viruses or on bacteria, she has finally decided to do both. In the Bondy-Denomy lab, Wearn-Xin is working on understanding how conserved genes may inhibit phage replication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In her free time, Wearn-Xin enjoys a good hike, exploring new food places and petting dogs that come her way."
